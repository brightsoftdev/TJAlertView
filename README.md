# TJAlertView

UIAlertView doesn't give access to its subviews, therefore it's not possible to customize its background image, labels or buttons. This drop in class aims to be an 100% API compatible replacement for UIAlertView.

[See video demo](https://vimeo.com/59879562)

**Warning: this is a work in progress and currently very little is implemented.**
